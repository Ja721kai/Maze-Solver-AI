# Maze-Solver-AI
Single Agent Reinforcement Learning in a Maze Environment For Educational Purpose

# Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Python Interpreter â‰¥ 3.5 <br/>

### Install the environment
Run following commands in your console:
```
$ git clone <repo-url>
$ cd Maze-Solver-AI
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

# Reinforcement Learning mixed with Model-View-Controller
Commonly the agent and the environment communicate directly and exchange actions with observations and rewards. This is the communication architecture that I will be using for this project.
